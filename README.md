# Hildelith F. Leyser

Neuroscience PhD candidate working on how social context, bodies, and sensory signals shape decision-making.  
I build experiments, analysis pipelines, and tools that connect behaviour, physiology, and neural data across species.

I currently work as a **Mechatronics and Machine Vision Engineer at [NethoLabs](https://netholabs.com/)**, where I design and prototype hardware–software systems for large-scale behavioural neuroscience.

My background sits between neuroscience, machine learning, and experimental systems design. I care less about abstract models in isolation and more about whether they survive contact with real animals, real movement, and real social structure.

## What I Actually Work With

### Behaviour & Neural Data

- fMRI analysis in awake, task-performing primates  
- Decision-making under uncertainty and social hierarchy effects  
- Multi-agent interaction and dominance-sensitive behaviour  
- Embodied behaviour: movement trajectories, posture, kinematics  

### Machine Learning & Modelling

- Markerless pose estimation (**DeepLabCut**) and multi-camera 3D reconstruction  
- Statistical modelling of choice behaviour (GLMs, Bayesian models, IRL)  
- Behaviour–neural alignment and event-based analysis  
- Early work on social and multi-agent models  

### Experimental Systems & Engineering

- Wireless power transfer and energy storage systems for wearable devices  
- Embedded power management for battery-operated experimental hardware  
- Additive manufacturing for rapid prototyping and iterative fabrication  
- CAD and mechanical design for experimental rigs and enclosures  
- Sensor integration, camera calibration, and hardware–software synchronisation  

### Tools & Development

- **Python** (NumPy, pandas, PyTorch, scientific pipelines)  
- **MATLAB** and **R** for statistics-heavy workflows  
- Experimental task design across hardware and software  
- **Unity / VR** for controlled cognitive and perceptual tasks  
- Lightweight front-end tools for data inspection and visualisation

## Current Focus

- End-to-end pipelines linking choice behaviour, movement, and neural signals  
- Behavioural deep learning for freely moving primates  
- Making complex datasets interpretable rather than opaque  
- Experimental paradigms that treat social context as structure, not noise
